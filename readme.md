It allows you to easily decide what render. 
* The first line let you choose if you want to randomly generate a shape (default), or using your mouse to create points.
* The second line let you decide if you want to create self-contained convex hull (Inception) or not.

* The third and fourth lines are for the window size.
* The last lines are generation settings, which are only applied if you choose the shape generation.

## User commands

* Use `left-click` to add points in the 'click generation'.
* Press `H` to toggle the drawing of points, only in the 'shape generation'.
